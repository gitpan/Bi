INSTALLATION

箆 installation is straightforward. If your CPAN shell is
set up, you should just be able to do

Download it, unpack it, then build it as per the usual:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make && make test

Then install it:

    % make install

DOCUMENTATION

箆 documentation is available as in POD. So you can do:

    % perldoc 箆
